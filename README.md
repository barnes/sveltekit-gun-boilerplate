# Sveltekit / GUN Boilerplate

This project is a dead simple CRUD example app using GUN as a backend. Users can create an account, and create, delete and edit 'tasks'.

# TODO

- Getting the tasks out of the DB is challening. Currently I'm getting the data, but parsing down to data for Svelte to chew on is proving challenging. I'm just no expert on JS objects, spreading, etc.
- Update and Delete functions for an item.
- Would like a modal popover for edit / create / delete. Click an existing task to pull open the same modal used to submit the task.
